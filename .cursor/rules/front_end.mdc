# Grupy-Sanca Website — Frontend Documentation

> Scope: this document covers **only the Vite React frontend** of `caue-paiva/Trabalho-Web`. The backend folder exists in the repo but is intentionally out of scope.

---

## 1) Project Overview

A single page application that presents the Grupy-Sanca community with four main user-facing areas: **Início**, **História**, **Galeria**, and **Código de Conduta**. The site aims to be a simple hub that explains the group, highlights upcoming events, and preserves the community’s memory for newcomers who arrive via search. ([GitHub][1])

---

## 2) Tech Stack

The frontend is built with:

* **Vite**
* **TypeScript**
* **React**
* **shadcn-ui**
* **Tailwind CSS** ([GitHub][1])

---

## 3) How to run locally

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --port 5173 --host 127.0.0.1 --strictPort
# open http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

These commands are defined in the README. ([GitHub][1])

---

## 4) Repository layout at a glance

Top level items relevant to the frontend:

```
Trabalho-Web/
├─ public/                 # Static assets served as-is by Vite
├─ src/                    # Frontend application code (entry, pages, components, etc.)
├─ index.html              # App shell with <div id="root"> and Vite entry
├─ package.json            # Frontend scripts and dependencies
├─ tailwind.config.ts      # Tailwind configuration
├─ postcss.config.js       # Tailwind/PostCSS pipeline
├─ vite.config.ts          # Vite build and dev-server configuration
├─ tsconfig*.json          # TypeScript configuration files
├─ components.json         # shadcn-ui component registry
└─ backend/                # Backend code (ignored in this doc)
```

You can see these files and folders in the repo root listing. ([GitHub][1])

---

## 5) Frontend entry points

* **`index.html`**
  Minimal HTML shell that mounts the SPA into a `#root` element. Vite injects the dev script or bundled assets here. ([GitHub][2])

* **`src/main.tsx`**
  React entry file that creates the root and renders `<App />`. Typical Vite React setup.

* **`src/App.tsx`**
  Top-level component that wires global providers and the router, and lays out persistent UI like the site header and footer.

> Note: the exact `src/` tree is not rendered in GitHub’s HTML viewer for anonymous sessions, but the structure below matches standard Vite React apps used with this stack and aligns with the README pages list.

---

## 6) Application structure

A conventional organization works well for this project:

```
src/
├─ pages/              # Route-level screens, one file per page
│  ├─ Index.tsx        # "Início"
│  ├─ Historia.tsx     # "História"
│  ├─ Galeria.tsx      # "Galeria"
│  └─ CodigoConduta.tsx# "Código de Conduta"
├─ components/         # Reusable UI (navigation, cards, dialogs, etc.)
│  └─ ui/              # shadcn-ui components (installed via components.json)
├─ assets/             # Images and static imports used by components
├─ lib/                # Small utilities, helpers, constants
├─ styles/             # Optional global CSS modules or additional Tailwind layers
├─ App.tsx             # App composition and routes
└─ main.tsx            # React root creation and bootstrapping
```

* **`pages/*`** map to the public sections documented in the README:

  * **Início**: quick intro and highlights for next events and social links
  * **História**: short narrative with selected historical photos
  * **Galeria**: grid of photos of past events, often opened in a modal for context
  * **Código de Conduta**: core values with an official policy link
    These four areas are explicitly defined in the project description. ([GitHub][1])

* **`components/*`** holds shared UI like the navigation bar, footer, buttons, cards, and any layout primitives. The presence of **`components.json`** at the root indicates **shadcn-ui** was set up to scaffold accessible, Tailwind-styled components into `src/components/ui`. ([GitHub][1])

* **Styling** is driven by **Tailwind CSS**, configured by `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` at the root. ([GitHub][1])

## 7) Main frontend logic

### 7.1 Routing and navigation

The app is a client-side SPA. A typical wiring in `App.tsx` uses React Router:

* Define routes for `/` (Início), `/historia`, `/galeria`, and `/codigo-de-conduta`.
* Render a persistent **Header/Nav** above `<Routes>` so navigation remains visible while pages switch.
* Add a catch-all `*` route to display a lightweight not-found screen.

This keeps transitions instant while preserving shareable URLs for each page.

### 7.2 State and data flow

* **Static content pages** like História and Código de Conduta render mostly static copy and media.
* **Galeria** displays a responsive grid of images. A modal or lightbox pattern is recommended for enlarging photos and showing captions.
* **Upcoming events** on Início can be fed by a simple fetch to the backend or an external events source, then rendered as cards. The README mentions “integração com o sistema atual de inscrição em eventos”, so linking out to the official registration flow from the card CTA keeps the frontend simple and fast. ([GitHub][1])

### 7.3 UI components

* **shadcn-ui** components are used to compose accessible dialogs, dropdowns, toasts, forms, and layout primitives, all styled via Tailwind. The repo includes `components.json` which is the registry file used by the shadcn CLI to install component files into `src/components/ui`. ([GitHub][1])

* **Tailwind CSS** utility classes are used directly in JSX for responsive layout and theming, avoiding large bespoke CSS files.

---

## 8) Developer notes

* **TypeScript**: Use strong component props typing and centralize any shared types in `src/lib` or a `src/types` folder.
* **Accessibility**: Favor shadcn-ui components for dialogs, menus, and other interactive elements since they wrap Radix primitives with solid a11y defaults.
* **Images**: Put large or unoptimized images in `public/` or import optimized assets via Vite so you get proper hashing and caching.
* **Environment**: If you add API calls for events, read the base URL from `import.meta.env` and document required env vars in the README.

---

## 9) What lives outside this doc

The repository also contains a **backend** folder. Backend APIs, controllers, and database concerns are intentionally excluded here.

---

## 10) References

* **README** — goals, audience, pages, stack, and dev commands are documented there. ([GitHub][1])
* **index.html** — SPA mount point used by Vite. ([GitHub][2])
* **Root listing** — confirms the presence of `src/`, `public/`, `components.json`, Tailwind and Vite configs, and TS configs. ([GitHub][1])
